# catch_phrase
This file contains two versions of the CatchPhrase Game, one standard version and one more involved curses version.
The reason for the seperation of files is that the curses version did not run on all terminals I tried it with. In my
experience it cooperates best with the Visual Studio Developer Command prompt.

To be playable, all this folder needs is the GoogleNews-vectors-negative300.bin.gz model in the data folder (accessible from https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7XkCwpI5KDYNlNUTTlSS21pQmM/edit).

Curses Gameplay continues until the timer runs out or 'q' is pressed. In order for Game Over dialogue to appear, the user needs to hit 'Enter' after the timer runs out.

Enjoy.
